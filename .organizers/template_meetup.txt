➡️ABOUT US

Our goal is to share our software-development experience on any level from junior to senior. It is your stage. You can always start with 10 min talk. Let me know, whether we can support you.

We want to keep being a community-driven meetup, no sales pitches and no we-are-hiring everywhere. So far, we are lucky to have sponsors who supports this vision.

Our github with previous talks: https://github.com/golangpoland/meetup_golang_warsaw

ps. The more source code the better in your talk :) It might be just few source files or --- the best --- a simple runnable project. We seek to encourage the community to go through your talk again, work with the code, and learn more on their own. We do not mind live demos :).

pps. Share your slides and code. What is there for you? Fame, github stars, FB/LI likes, and feedback.

➡️WORKSHOP

Next: golang in Business Link Astoria. Next 2: kubernetes, Next 3: Golang Concurrency.

We want to have a carrot not a stick, aka black lists, for the ones who do not come :D. My personal goal is 65 avg per meetup. So far: 40-55.
