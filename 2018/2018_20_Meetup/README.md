## Golang Warsaw #20

### Summary

Great #20 Golang meetup Warsaw. Join us next month!

~40 seasoned and fresh community members.

Few words from the organizers and we took a deep dive into best practices. Oleg shared Golang Do and Dont's leant from his daily work and an Opensource project. A moment to grab a beer, snack, or a flavored sugared water. A moment to get ready to talk about Distributed Systems and Consensus Protocols. Stanisław took the stage to explain us how Raft works. Yes, the Raft algorithm in Hashicorp Consul, Etcd, and Cockroachdb.
Since Kubernetes, with this level of hype, is expected to run on your fridge till 2020, we have to get ready. In the last talk, Wojtek demoed how to realize zero-downtime deployment strategies on k8s and how to implement a Golang service to not drop any of user requests.
