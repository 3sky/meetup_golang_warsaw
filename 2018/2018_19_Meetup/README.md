#### Long

What a start for the Golang community in Warsaw!

~50 new and old community members and good talks based on the speakers' experience working with Golang.

After the introduction, Jakub Daliga shared what he had learnt, the hard way, being the only backend developer in a startup. Lot of code and examples of what worked for him and what kept him awake in the night.

A short break just to grab a beer to get ready for a debugging adventure. Tomek Janiszewski took us to the Hashicorp Consul code to hunt a bug involving slices. Slices are really nit, but they might bite you if you forget how they work.

The last presentation was about better Golang linting with go-critic. We love how best-practice enforcement is a part of the language.  So, it was exciting to meet one of these brave developers bringing better linters to the language. Oleg Kovalov showed us how go-critic works, the checks it provides, and how easy is to write your own check for making the language we love better. Check the tool on github - https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic .
