## Golang Warsaw #21

### Summary

Thank you all for attending #21 Golang Meetup Warsaw.

We had 2 talks. Tomasz Grodzki  talked about why Golang looks like Golang and reasons behind its most distinguish features. He brought also few unknown facts. Even the most experienced Golang Developers rushed to check google in disbelieve.

Serverless and Golang, can you imagine a better combination? But. How to start? Bartosz Bonis≈Çawski came to help. His talk and live demo was about deploying your first AWS Lamba in Go with the serverless framework. Love this style of engineer-to-engineer talk - very clear and focused on the topic, with bits of humor
