## Golang Warsaw #23

### Summary

Thank you all for attending [#23 Golang Meetup Warsaw](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-Warsaw/events/257705831/). The next meetup - 13 March 2019 @przestrzen.fb.com.

We had 2 talks and a little surprise in between - a get-know-each-other round: 

1.  Reflection Dark Arts - RafaÅ‚ JÄ™czalik [ScyllaDB]

2. How to monitor your Golang App with Prometheus - Wojciech BarczyÅ„ski [Hypatos.ai]

Our get-together session received positive feedback (aka nobody run away). So, we will repeat the session for the next X meetups. Later, every 2nd month.

You will find slides and demos linked to our meetup github (https://github.com/golangpoland/meetup_golang_warsaw).

ðŸ”¥ Great news, Jacek Seliga and Michal GoliÅ„ski joins the organizers team. So, we will have capacity to make more and try few new things.

Thank you, [Crux](http://www.crux.boulder.pl/) for hosting us.

ps. Regarding the workshops on Golang and other engineering topics, they are coming.
